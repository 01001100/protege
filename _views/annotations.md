blurb: Displays annotation assertions for the selected entity.
---

An annotation assertion consists of a subject that is the target of the assertion, an [annotation property](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Annotation_Properties), and an annotation value.  The value may be either a [literal](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Literals), [IRI](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#IRIs) (of an entity in the ontology or external to the ontology) or an [anonymous individual](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Anonymous_Individuals).  The annotations view displays annotations whose subject is the IRI of the selected entity in {{site.protege}}.

## Annotations view

The annotations view displays annotation assertions for the selected entity.  The view lists annotations sorted by their annotation property.  Certain well known properties, for example ```rdfs:label``` have a higher priority in the sorting over other annotation properties and will always appear at the top of the view.

For each annotation displayed in the view, the rendering includes the annotation property (shown in blue), the annotation value datatype of language tag (shown in light gray) and the actual annotation value.

Annotations on annotations are shown inline by default.  In the image below, the definition annotation has two other annotations on it. These can be hidden by toggling [Display axiom annotations inline]({{site.baseurl}}/menus/display-axiom-annotations-inline).

## Annotation editor

To edit an annotation, or add a new annotation, you should use the annotation editor, which is displayed when you click the (+) button or the edit button (o) or when you double click on an annotation.

The annotation editor is split into a left hand side pane and a right hand side pane.

Select an annotation property from the left (or add your own on in the top section if you want).

On the right hand side you specify a value for the annotation.  You can specify:

* A **Literal**, which is a string or number.  The literal may have a language tag or it may be typed with a datatype.  You can specify a type with the Type dropdown, or you can specify a language tag in the language tag editor.
* An **Entity IRI** that points to an entity in the ontology or imports closure.
* An **Arbitrary IRI** that may point at anything.
* An **Anonymous Individual** and associated property values.
