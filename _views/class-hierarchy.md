blurb: Displays the asserted or inferred class hierarchy for the active ontologies.

The class hierarchy view displays the asserted and inferred class hierarchies.  The asserted class hierarchy is visible by default.

The asserted class hierarchy view is one of the primary navigation devices in {{site.protege}}.  It is presented as a tree where children represent subclasses of the parent class.  A class will be shown under another class if it is asserted to be a SubClassOf that other class, or if it is asserted to be EquivalentTo a class expression that is an intersection containing that other class as an operand.  For example, if the ontology contains ```A SubClassOf B```, then ```A``` will appear under ```B``` in the tree.  Similarly, if the ontology contains ```E Equivalent to B and hasPart some C``` then ```E``` will also be shown as a chid of ```B``` in the tree.  Any classes that are not asserted to be a subclass of some other class will show up directly under owl:Thing (the root).

## Cycles

Classes that appear in a cycle of SubClassOf axioms, for example ```A SubClassOf B```, ```B SubClassOf C``` and ```C SubClassOf A``` will be collapsed and shown together, with one tree node for each class in the cycle so that each class may be selected.  An example is shown below.

The reason for this notation is that a cycle in the class hierarchy between two or more classes states that the classes in the cycle are equivalent.  This is because ```A EquivalentTo B``` is an abbreviation for the two axioms ```A SubClassOf B``` and ```B SubClassOf A```.

## Switching between Asserted and Inferred modes

The asserted class hierarchy is shown by default.  To switch to the inferred hierarchy either select "Inferred" from the drop-down or press 'i' when the hierarchy has the focus.  If the inferred hierarchy is shown, the asserted hierarchy can be displayed by selecting "Asserted" from the drop-down or press 'a' when the hierarchy has the focus.

## Icon meaning

The class hierarchy contains two types of icons: Solid yellow icons and yellow icons with three white lines through the middle, representing the equivalence symbol.

The icons containing the equivalence symbol (three white lines) denote classes that are asserted to be equivalent to some other class expression.  These are known as defined classes.

The solid yellow icons denote classes that are not defined classes (i.e. aren't asserted to be equivalent to some other class expression).  These classes are known as primitive classes.

## Drag and Drop

It is possible to edit some of the SubClassOf axioms in the ontology by dragging and dropping tree nodes in the asserted class hierarchy.  Drag and Drop only works for primitive classes - that is, classes that have a solid yellow icon.  Dropping a class on top of an other class will make it a SubClassOf that other class.
