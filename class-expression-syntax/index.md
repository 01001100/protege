The [Manchester OWL Syntax](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/) is used for presenting and writing various kinds of complex expressions in Protégé.  This page provides a brief overview of the class expression syntax.  

Class expressions are used to describe individuals that share common characteristics and this includes both class names (named classes) and complex class expressions.  The table below presents the keywords that are used to build up complex class expressions along with some examples.  Class expressions can be nested to arbitrary depths in order to build up rich descriptions of the domain being modelled.
