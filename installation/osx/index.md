Installing Protégé on Mac OS X
==============================

Protege Desktop 5.0 is distributed in the form of a ZIP file from the main Protege website, and includes the 64-bit Java Runtime Environment (JRE). So, it is not necessary to have Java pre-installed on your computer to run Protege.

1. Go to the [download page](http://protege.stanford.edu/products.php#desktop-protege) and click the Download button.
2. Once the download completes, navigate to the folder where the ZIP file was downloaded. On a Mac, this will typically be your "Downloads" folder. Unpack it and you should see:
