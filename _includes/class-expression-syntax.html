          Also known as, an "SomeValueFrom restriction" or an "Existential
          Restriction".  This kind of class expression consists of a property
          (in this case hasPet) and a class expression that is known as
          a filler (in this case the filler is Dog).</div>

        <div class="tip">Here, Tibbs is a specific individual.  Intuitively this would describe Tibb's owners.
            Note that this is a short cut for, and logically equivalent to, (<span class="expr">hasPet <span class="ms-rkw">some</span> {Tibbs}</span>), where the curly brackets describe a class of specific individuals - in this case, a class of one individual that is Tibbs.
